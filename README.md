## Git & GitHub

#### ðŸ§© Git

**Git** is a distributed **version control system (VCS)** created by Linus Torvalds (the creator of Linux) in 2005.

It allows developers to:

- Track changes in source code.
- Collaborate with others without overwriting work.
- Roll back to previous versions if needed.
- Work offline (local repository).

**ðŸ”‘ Key Features of Git**

- **Distributed System** â†’ Every developer has a full copy of the repository, including history.
- **Branching and Merging** â†’ Work on features independently, then merge them back.
- **Staging Area** â†’ Control what goes into the next commit.
- **Snapshots, not diffs** â†’ Git saves a snapshot of the project at each commit.
- **Speed & Performance** â†’ Lightweight and fast, even for large projects.
