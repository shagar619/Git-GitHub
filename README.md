## Git & GitHub

#### üß© Git

**Git** is a distributed **version control system (VCS)** created by Linus Torvalds (the creator of Linux) in 2005.

It allows developers to:

- Track changes in source code.
- Collaborate with others without overwriting work.
- Roll back to previous versions if needed.
- Work offline (local repository).

**üîë Key Features of Git**

- **Distributed System** ‚Üí Every developer has a full copy of the repository, including history.
- **Branching and Merging** ‚Üí Work on features independently, then merge them back.
- **Staging Area** ‚Üí Control what goes into the next commit.
- **Snapshots, not diffs** ‚Üí Git saves a snapshot of the project at each commit.
- **Speed & Performance** ‚Üí Lightweight and fast, even for large projects.

#### üåê GitHub

**GitHub** is a cloud-based hosting platform for Git repositories.

It provides:

- Remote storage for Git repositories.
- Collaboration tools (issues, pull requests, discussions).
- CI/CD integration (GitHub Actions).
- Project management features (kanban boards, milestones).
- Social coding (followers, stars, forks).

#### üìä Difference Between Git and GitHub

| Feature              | **Git** (Tool) | **GitHub** (Platform) |
|----------------------|----------------|------------------------|
| **Definition**       | A distributed version control system (software). | A cloud-based hosting service for Git repositories. |
| **Type**             | Command-line tool (runs locally on your computer). | Web-based platform (runs online, requires internet). |
| **Usage**            | Tracks changes, manages versions, and branches locally. | Stores repositories remotely, enables collaboration and sharing. |
| **Offline/Online**   | Works offline. | Requires internet to access repos. |
| **Ownership**        | Open-source, developed by Linus Torvalds. | Owned by Microsoft (since 2018). |
| **Authentication**   | No account needed (local use). | Requires account to host/share repos. |
| **Collaboration**    | Limited to your local machine unless you push to a shared repo. | Rich collaboration: pull requests, code reviews, issues, discussions. |
| **Alternatives**     | None (Git is the underlying system). | GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure Repos (all Git hosting platforms). |
